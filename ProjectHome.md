nxPascal is a free game engine that tries to remain lightweight and portable. It is compilable under latest Lazarus on possibly all operating systems, and many Delphi versions. For now only OpenGL is supported.

More in the wiki [Introduction](Introduction.md). Includes links to unit documentation.

Latest source version always in SVN tree. Zip packets may not be updated as regularly.

If you need help for installing latest version with SVN, [SVNGuide](SVNGuide.md) should help. It is really quick operation.

Forum thread for the project is at:

_If you wish to send me private message, you can do it there or Lazarus forums too (to User137)._
